Here’s a concise README.md for your project:

# AWS DevOps Tooling Lab

This project is a hands-on lab designed to help learn and explore AWS DevOps services such as **CodeBuild**, **CodePipeline**, and **S3**.

## 📌 Purpose

To build and deploy a simple static website using AWS-native CI/CD tools. This lab demonstrates:
- Using CodePipeline for automated deployments
- Using CodeBuild to run build steps via `buildspec.yml`
- Hosting build artifacts on S3 as a static site

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **AWS CodePipeline** – Automates the CI/CD workflow
- **AWS CodeBuild** – Executes build steps
- **Amazon S3** – Hosts the static website
- **GitHub** – Source control

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Push code to GitHub
2. CodePipeline detects the change
3. CodeBuild runs the buildspec and prepares deployment artifacts
4. Artifacts are deployed to the S3 bucket configured for static site hosting

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- Add automated tests
- Deploy to Lambda, ECS, or EKS
- Integrate CloudFront + ACM for secure HTTPS hosting
- Add approval workflows
